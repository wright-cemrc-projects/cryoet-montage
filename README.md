# CryoET Montage
---

This repository provides resources for the montage tomography with SerialEM.

![Overview of Cryo Montage](images/SupplementaryFigure_1_small.png)

## Contents

1. The SerialEM macros and documentations for running montage tomography data collections are described here.

	[Documentation for SerialEM data collections](SerialEM/README.md)
	

2. TomoGrapher is a tomography simulation program for pre-planning the data collections.

	[TomoGrapher documentation](TomoGrapher/README.md)

3. Python scripts for stitching images and building stacks are described here.

	[Python scripts for preprocessing of the tilt series](Python/README.md)

4. After assembling initial stitching, the individual tilts may need to have further manual stitching.  This walkthrough describes how to make these adjustments with Etomo and Midas.
